A humble web crawler framework.

In order to build the framework one needs to run the following command on the root folder of the project:

make build

There are are 3 explicit make targets:

clean: Removes *.class files and thus cleans the project
build: Builds the framework and produces a jar file

all  : The default target. Runs first clean and then build targets above.
