A humble web crawler.

In order to build the application you need to run the following command on the root folder of the project:

make build

There are are 4 explicit make targets:

clean: Removes *.class files and thus cleans the project
build: Builds the project
run  : Runs the project

all  : The default target. Runs all 3 targets above.
